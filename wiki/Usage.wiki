== To Copy a Single File's Full Path and Name ==

  #  Launch the FileNameCopy executable (you should see a new icon appear in the system tray)
  #  Use Windows Explorer/My Computer to find the file whose name you'd like to copy
  #  Click on the FileNameCopy icon, a window (The "File Drop Window") should appear above the tray
  #  Drag the file whose name you'd like to copy onto the File Drop Window
  #  The file's full path will appear in the file list in the File Drop Window
  #  The file's full path will now be in the Windows clipboard, allowing you to paste it wherever you'd like
